# Exercise 1: Create your Cloud environment

These steps are required during an IBM Workshop where you get access to pre-provisoned clusters.

If you already have access to a (lite) Kubernetes clsuster on IBM Cloud, continue with Exercise 2.

## 1. Create an IBM Cloud Account

We will use pre-provisioned Kubernetes clusters on the IBM Cloud for this workshop. You need an IBM Cloud Account to assign yourself one of these clusters:

1. You can register at [https://cloud.ibm.com](https://cloud.ibm.com).

    We need your email address, a password, your name, and your country. 
    
    During the registration, we will send a verification code to your email address that you have to enter into the registration form. 
    
    Registration is free and without any obligations.

1. Logon to the IBM Cloud Dashboard [https://cloud.ibm.com](https://cloud.ibm.com).

## 2. Assign yourself a pre-provisoned cluster

In this step you will assign yourself a pre-provisioned cluster. 

1. Your lab instructor will provide a link to an application and a "lab key". Open the application in your browser:
   ![granttool1](../images/granttool1.png)
   
2. Enter the lab key provided and your IBMid (it is the email address you used to register at the IBM Cloud), agree to the T&Cs, and click "Submit":

   ![granttool1](../images/granttool2.png)
   
    Of course your cluster will be named differently and the lab account you need to select from the pull-down in the IBM Cloud Dashboard is **1840867 - Advowork**.
