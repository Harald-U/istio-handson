# Hands-On Istio 

## Manage Microservice Communication with Kubernetes and Istio Service Mesh


Do you need to select the right technologies to build your next application? Get your hands dirty with those technologies before you start your build. Learn how Kubernetes and Istio give you full control over your microservices. 

Kubernetes minimizes outages and disruptions through self-healing, intelligent scheduling, horizontal scaling, and load balancing. 

[Istio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/info/istio) is an open platform to connect, secure, control and observe microservices, also known as a service mesh, on cloud platforms such as Kubernetes. With Istio, you can manage network traffic, load balance across microservices, enforce access policies, verify service identity, secure service communication, and observe exactly what is going on with your services.

In this workshop, you can see how to install and use Istio alongside microservices for a simple app called [Cloud Native Starter](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-native-starter).

## Objectives
After you complete this workshop, you'll be able to:
- Install Istio in your cluster
- Deploy the Cloud Native Starter sample
- Set up the Istio Ingress Gateway
- Use metrics, logging, and tracing to observe services
- Perform simple traffic management, such as A/B tests and canary deployments
- Secure your service mesh
